# development-platforms-ca

A backend solution for the development platforms course assignment. A REST API with authenticated endpoints. Code from the modules provided by Noroff, with changes to handle the CA task.\

**Motivation**\
Why i chose option 1:
I chose the first option due to the fact that I have seen SQL be a valued trait in many job listings and that it simply interested me more than using Supabase.\
I enjoyed building the database and its tables. Mostly due to the fact that I struggled with the API part of the task.\

I found it difficult to implement the interfaces I made, without having the code crash. Since I followed the modules when I made the task, it was quite hard to keep up with all the components I downloaded. My main issue with this task was not knowing how to handle the data relationship between the api calls and database.\

As benefits go, I think building an API and database gives you more control of your own data, which in turn makes it safer. Another plus is that it is free to do and maintain.\
